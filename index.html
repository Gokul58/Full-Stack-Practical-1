    <h2>About the Course</h2>
    Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user
    interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything form building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
